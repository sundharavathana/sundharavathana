# phase wise project submission
# website traffic analysis using ibm cognos
data source:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobnau/daily-website-visitors)
reference:kaggle.com(USA mousing)
# import
Python (version 3.x)
Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
IBM Cognos (installed and set up)
# Data Preparation and Analysis with Python
# Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone :https://github.com/sundharavathana/sundharavathana.git
# Navigate to the project directory:
cd website-traffic-analysis
# nstall the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Prepare your website traffic data. The data should be in a CSV format. You can use your own data or a sample dataset.
# Load and analyze the data using Python:
python data_analysis.py
# Data Integration and Visualization with IBM Cognos
Launch IBM Cognos and create a new report or dashboard project.

Connect to your Python-preprocessed data source. Use connectors or ODBC/JDBC connections to integrate the data.

Create visualizations in IBM Cognos. Build charts, graphs, and tables to present the data.

Customize the visualizations by setting properties, adding filters, and defining drill-through actions as needed.

Save and share your report or dashboard within the IBM Cognos environment.
# Machine Learning Models
This project includes machine learning models for predictive analytics. You can use the Jupyter Notebook machine_learning.ipynb to explore and fine-tune these models. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and Scikit-learn installed.

# Run Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open and execute the machine_learning.ipynb notebook to train, test, and evaluate machine learning models for website traffic prediction
